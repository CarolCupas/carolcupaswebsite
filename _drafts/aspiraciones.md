People change and their aspirations as well. If today, I had to respond to ¿how do I look within 5 years? any answer would be absurd. Looking at my version from five years ago, I could say "you don't have an idea" and it's because almost nothing that I have experienced in recent years, happened as I imagined, someway, has been even better.

Of course, I have a desire for self-improvement and I have spent many years of my life preparing myself to be a competent professional and successful in what I do but what money can't buy is what I aspire the most, for example having a place called home.

When I moved to Madrid, I went from having a duplex to a small loft, from having a 5-passenger SUV to using the subway among other things more, but I admit that my life was simplified pleasantly. Obviously, sometimes it's phenomenal to have more space and freedom to move around, however, I don't need that to be happy.

My aspiration as a professional is that my job is appreciated and useful to other people also do their job and the result of all the work will be a huge contribution to the company in order to comply or exceed the goals. Sure, The payment must be fair and the promotions being timely.

There is nothing more unpleasant than feeling that you don't fit in a place or your work hard isn't being valued; people are the most valuable asset of a company so whether I don't feel comfortable, I'll get out of it soon unless something changes.

During one of my jobs, I lost a good coworker who passed away, this man was really nice, he worked after hours, but he had time to make a few jokes. It was like a nightmare to see how the company substituted him the following week, which open my eyes to realize that anybody is indispensable for a company and the show must continue.

Mi aspiración como profesional es que mi trabajo sea valorado, que sirva para ayudar a otras personas a hacer su trabajo y que el trabajo resultante sea una contribución para que la empresa cumpla y supere los objetivos trazados. Claro, la retribución salarial debe ser justa y las promociones deben ser oportunas. No hay nada más desagradable que sentir que no encajas en un lugar o que no se valore algo en lo que trabajas; las personas somos el activo más valioso de una empresa y si no me siento a gusto en un lugar me iré pronto a menos que algo cambie.

Durante uno de mis trabajos, tuve que pasar por el fallecimiento de un apreciado compañero, un señor muy amable que trabajaba sobretiempo y que a pesar de todo, tenía tiempo para bromear. Fue como un balde de agua fría ver que a la semana siguiente ya habían cubierto su vacante y me abrió los ojos a que para una empresa, la función debe continuar porque nadie es indispensable.

So far, I aspire to have a good job where I will be valuable for who I am and the contributions made, have a family who knows how much I love it, have trusted friends and mainly dreaming big because I don't have an idea of what is coming in future yet, I believe God has something awesome on mind:

Al momento, aspiro a tener un buen trabajo donde me sienta valorada por quién soy y lo que aporto, a tener una familia que se sepa y sienta amada por mí, a tener amigos verdaderos y principalmente a soñar en grande porque aún no tengo idea de lo que vendrá en los próximos años, sin duda, Dios tiene algo bueno en mente:

> Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV). For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.
