Knowing there are so many negative things in the world, I'm going to avoid wasting time writing about it, so this post isn't about haters (toxic people) but how to react and deal with them.

It's clear to me that I'm far from being a gold coin that everybody loves, so I have had unfortunate moments in which I coexisted with haters. The curious thing is that these people, without knowing me, created their own concept of me and treated me with contempt.

Sincerely, I prefer to avoid conflicts and my style is to say things to the person's face directly respectfully and without hurting feelings. The easy way would be to get away from such people however when daily interaction is required due to common commitments, it's better to face the situation as soon as possible.

I must admit that the first time I had to deal with haters, I didn't know what to do, I wondered "¿what happened with fulan@?" I thought anyone could have a bad day, and I was the first person to cross the road, so I received the damage (naive of me... hehe). My mistake was not realized in time that it was something else and when I faced the situation in order to understand the reasons for the bad attitude, it was late, the person became the one who was doing nothing and was not willing to solve things.

Upon that, I asked myself the famous question "**_What would Jesus do_?" (_WWJD)_** and that was the key to be able to cope with the situation.

Thinking about what would Jesus do in a similar situation surrounded by haters, led me to his cross where he was crucified by people who he didn't hurt, offended, humiliated or anything like that and despite that they crucified him. Jesus' attitude is supernatural evidently, He not only didn't react in the same way, but he prayed to God for forgiving them because they didn't know what they did... OMG!! Wow! No doubt, he is my superhero par excellence. 

Lo sé, perfecta no soy peeeero estoy aprendiendo de un gran maestro, así que decidí actuar de la manera en la que Él lo hizo, amar al prójimo como a mí misma, es decir tratar a los haters con amor (a fin de cuenta el problema lo tienen ellos conmigo) y por otra parte empecé a orar por ellos para que Dios sanara sus corazones y que las ofensas que yo pude haberles causado (sin saber) fueran sanadas. Ojo, lo anterior no significa que me deje menospreciar o humillar por nadie, hay límites que recomiendo no cruzar.

Francamente es difícil pero no imposible, así que "_metele caña_" como dicen aquí.
