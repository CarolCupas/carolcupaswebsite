excerpt: It's said that friends are a treasure and yes they are because good friends
  are scarce today. Having people interested in knowing how you are, became having
  followers on social networks, however, having people who make plans to meet and
  see each other, go on a picnic or watch a movie at home is priceless.

Around the world, there are uncountable beliefs and I respect these due we are free to choose whether or not to believe in the God who created and loved us so much to send his unique son to rescue us. For me, life has not been a journey of roses but knowing Jesus Christ has been a blessing. Since I was a child, I have had a special relationship with him, he was the imaginary friend that many children usually have. My education was in a catholic school and I attend mass with my family on Sundays.

Since young, I understood what Jesus meant in my life, he was the friend who listened to me, took care of me even gave me beautiful sunsets wildflowers to enjoy.

> _For me, wherever I am, God is there and in so many ways makes me feel safe._

When I arrived in Madrid, I didn't know what church go until, thanks to Marvin, we found Amistad Cristiana. Since the first day, we felt between friends and it's the AC's DNA is to receive people to present to Jesus, that's why I felt as I met them since always because I already met Jesus.

Al llegar a Madrid, no sabía donde asistir pero gracias a Marvin, encontramos [**Amistad Cristiana**](https://amistadcristianamadrid.org/ "AmistadCristiana"). Desde el primer día, nos sentimos entre amigos y es que como dicen, el ADN de Amistad es acoger a las personas y que puedan conocer a Jesús; pero en mi caso, cómo ya lo conozco desde siempre, es cómo si ya los conociera también a ellos desde siempre porque le conocen a Él.

Honestly, they are a blessing and also as a second family that shows us we aren't alone. Thanks!

Certainly, I met people from different countries during the master's degree, and we shared nice experiences like birthday celebrations, Christmas dinner, trips, etc. although many of them returned to their countries, I know our friendship will keep-alive because the friendship doesn't know frontiers. 

Sinceramente, son una bendición, y son una segunda familia que nos muestran que no estamos solos. _Gracias!_

Desde luego, durante el máster logré conocer personas de diferentes nacionalidades y compartimos experiencias muy gratas desde paseos, cumpleaños, cenas navideñas, picnic, etc. y aunque muchos han regresado a sus países, sé que la amistad perdurará a través del tiempo porque la amistad no conoce de fronteras.
