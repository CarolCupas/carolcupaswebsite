The popular proverb is "_the worst attempt is the one that is not done_" but I like my own version more: "_the **best** attempt is the one that is done_". The meaning is the same, however changing words, the connotation of the sentence is different, from negative (worst) to positive (best).

Today's children seem to be born with an integrated chip to facilitate them to use technology but the truth is that nobody was born knowing things but rather learning them; from the basics such as starting to walk to the most complex ones such as the development machine learning algorithms, demand our motivation that drives us to try it.

Easily, we find thousands of excuses when a challenge arises, a classic example is "I'm going to lose weight", however, a few days later, we quit the exercises and said goodbye to the diet. Although the excuses may be valid, it doesn't mean that we can't try one more time and achieve it.

> Motivation is **essential**, believing in ourselves, recognize our limitations but also our potential to go for it. Don't underestimate yourself, wanting is power.

The changes of success or not are equal, fifty-fifty. Our part is to make the decision of where we want to focus our thoughts and energy: to everything that can go wrong that leads us to be unmotivated or to everything that we can achieve that motivates us. That is where the proverb fits "_the worst attempt is the one that is not done_". For me, an unsuccessful attempt is a certain failure, we won't achieve anything, however, trying something opens us the door of the possibilities. 

> Isaías 41:10 (RVR1960) No temas, porque yo estoy contigo; no desmayes, porque yo soy tu Dios que te esfuerzo; siempre te ayudaré, siempre te sustentaré con la diestra de mi justicia.

Big leaders and characters of this generation have succeeded and reached their dreams because they had enough courage to challenge themselves. My daily challenge is to be the best version than I can be. I don't know what impact will have in the world but at least I hope to be a blessing for the surrounded world, nothing lost trying.

If you can dream it, can do it

Grandes líderes y personajes de esta generación, han logrado triunfar y alcanzar sus sueños porque tuvieron la valentía suficiente para desafiarse a sí mismos. Mi desafío diario es ser la mejor versión de mí que pueda ser, no sé que impacto tendrá en el mundo pero al menos espero ser de bendición al mundo que me rodea, nada pierdo al intentarlo.
