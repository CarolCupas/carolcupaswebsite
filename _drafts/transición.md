excerpt: The routine bores me and for that, the changes often occur in my life. From
  a new hairstyle to my country of residence. Definitely, changes bring some challenges
  more difficult than others, but during this new stage of my life, I experience some
  professional challenges.

Upon the master's degree graduation, I have experienced a new phase of job search in Madrid. Foreigners (majority) have to be highly qualified to obtain the sponsorship of a company to process the work permit or wait out an interval of years.

Today, finding a job is almost a job and I have had several interviews so far, but these companies are not willing to offer me a contract to process the work permit (perhaps due to ignorance of the process). Despite that, the good side is my profile fits what they are looking for.

_Honestly, the idea of starting my own business is becoming really attractive lately, what slows me down a bit is to face the reality of the need to earn income soon._

Of course, standing idly by is not my thing, so I spend my time doing volunteer work, learning something new as creating a website among other things. I know that time is valuable therefore I invest it in what produces value or wellness.

Nothing of above would be possible if I don't strive to do my best on everything I do and put my trust in God, that's why the promise of Mark 9:23 is my favorite one: "_If you can’? said Jesus, **Everything is possible for one who believes.**"_. The word 'everything' followed by the word "POSSIBLE" makes an enormous difference in my life.
