excerpt: The routine bores me and for that, the changes often occur in my life. From
  a new hairstyle to my country of residence. Definitely, changes bring some challenges
  more difficult than others, but during this new stage of my life, I experience some
  professional challenges.

Upon the master's degree graduation, I have experienced a new phase of job search in Madrid. Foreigners (majority) have to be highly qualified to obtain the sponsorship of a company to process the work permit or wait out an interval of years.

Today, finding a job is almost a job and I have had several interviews so far, but these companies are not willing to offer me a contract to process the work permit (perhaps due to ignorance of the process). Despite that, the good side is my profile fits what they are looking for.

_Honestly, the idea of starting my own business is becoming really attractive lately, what slows me down a bit is to face the reality of the need to earn income soon._

Of course, stand idly by is not my thing, so I invest my time doing volunteer work, learning something new as create a website between other things. I know that time is valued therefore I intend to use it doing what produces value or wellness.

Nothing of above was possible if I don't strive to do my best on everything I do and put my trust in God, that's why the promise of Mark 9:23 is my favorite one: "If you can’? said Jesus. **_Everything is possible for one who believes._**". The word 'everything' follows by the word "POSSIBLE" makes an enormous difference in my life.

Por supuesto, quedarme de brazos cruzados no es lo mío, así que ocupo mi tiempo haciendo voluntario, aprendiendo algo nuevo como crear un website, entre otras cosas. Sé que el tiempo es valioso y por eso lo invierto en aquello que pueda generar valor o bienestar.

Nada de lo anterior me fuera posible si no me esfuerzo en dar lo mejor de mí en lo que hago y deposite mi confianza en Dios por eso la promesa de Marcos 9:23 es mi favorita porque dice **_"Si puedes creer, al que cree TODO le es POSIBLE..."_**; la palabra TODO seguido de la palabra POSIBLE marca una enorme diferencia en mi vida.
