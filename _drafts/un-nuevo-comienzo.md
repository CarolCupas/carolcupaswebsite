I am a person who adapts very well to changes and I organize myself to achieve my goals.

A couple of years ago, I decided to give a twist to my day to day, therefore I looked for a job as a professor at university. To my surprise, my engineering degree was not enough, not even the master's degree in higher education that I had just obtained, besides that, I had to have a master's degree or a specialization in some branch of my professional area.

Since I completed all my studies in my country, I explored the options to study abroad. After two months, I received the call that changed everything, I got a scholarship to study a master degree in Big Data & BI in Madrid, What a thrill!

That's how I quit my job, said goodbye to my family and friends, and undertook my journey to Madrid with my husband Marvin. But it was until we got on the aircraft seat to the Barajas airport that I finally had time to assimilate all the changes that came with migrating to a country so far from home.

Despite the fact that almost every year, I took vacations and visited many new places, moving to another continent for at least one year, it was too different, this implies starting from scratch: friendships, meals, spots, idioms, in conclusion, a new lifestyle.

I've been blessed to share everything with Marvin, I guess that migrating alone would be more difficult. Today, we have new friends, favorite dishes, and places to have tasty coffee or walk our pets.

No doubt, we miss our families, to old friends and stay at home, but we still want to have new adventures and visit other countries. After all, there is only one life.

From everything, we learn, and I am glad to experience how is to migrate to the country, spare me the tale.

Sin duda, extrañamos a nuestra familia, a los amigos de siempre y a estar en casa pero creo que aún tenemos deseos de tener nuevas aventuras y conocer más países. Después de todo, la vida es una.

De todas las experiencias se aprende y me alegro de experimentar lo que conlleva migrar de país, por lo menos, ya no me echan cuento.
