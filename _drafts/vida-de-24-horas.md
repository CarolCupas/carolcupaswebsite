excerpt: Living the present is a gift, laugh and share smiles today, put on your best
  outfit today, call your loved ones and tell them how much you miss them, hanging
  out with friends, embrace your dreams today because you don't know if there are
  more opportunities.

Living one day at a time knowing that tomorrow is not promised for anyone, makes me appreciate what is really valuable. I am aware of life is fleeting and everything can change when you least expect it.

I have always thought that it's important to plan, not to postpone anything for later, and not to make decisions lightly, but there must be a balance. I meditate before deciding to do something, I evaluate scenarios in my mind and confess that things can accumulate and I get to worry about things that have not happened yet or that I can not change, so I remember the following verse of the bible:

> Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
>
> Matthew 6:34 (NIV)

and tell myself that makes no sense being worried about anything. In fact, if today was my last day on earth, I shouldn't waste it feeling bad, rather than I should be grateful for the chance I have to enjoy the company of my loved ones, hear their voice, looking to their eyes and even in the distance, express them my love.

Short time ago, someone asked me "¿do you imagine if we could to rewind time?", although it might be useful, the life doesn't include that option, nonetheless, life offers us a new opportunity each day to start from scratch like a canvas in blank to design the first day of the rest of our life.

On my end, I propone myself to write good chapters in my remaining days and first of all to take advantage of each these to answer the calls of relatives, send messages to friends, meet to neighbords, share coffess with Marvin, thank God by his fidelity and all that He has planned to me.

Hace poco alguien me dijo "¿_te imaginas que pudiéramos hacer rewind?_" (refiriéndose a retroceder en el tiempo) y aunque quizás sería útil, la vida no incluye ésa opción, sin embargo, lo que sí nos ofrece es una nueva oportunidad para empezar cada día de cero, a partir de un lienzo en blanco para diseñar el primer día del resto de nuestra vida.

Por mi parte, me propongo a escribir buenos capítulos en los días que me restan y ante todo poder aprovechar todos y cada uno de ellos para atender las llamadas de familiares, enviar mensajes a mis amigos, conocer a mis vecinos, compartir cafés con Marvin, agradecer a Dios por su inmensa fidelidad y por todo lo que ha planeado para mí.
